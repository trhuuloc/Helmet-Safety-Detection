# Helmet-Safety-Detection


This is my Helmet Safety Detection project using YOLOv10.
In the Part 1.ipnyb, we test YOLOv10 to deject object in a picture of VietNam cross-street.
In the Part 2.ipnyb, we train and validate YOLOv10 on a safety helmet dataset on 50 epochs, 320x320 image_size and 128 batch_size.

## Installation


**Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/trhuuloc/Helmet-Safety-Detection
    cd Helmet-Safety-Detection
    ```

You can test and train epoch, image_size, batch_size to see the difference.
